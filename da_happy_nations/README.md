# Happy nations
## by S. Huff


## Dataset

[Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/) provides huge collections of curated datasets. To examine the relationship between hdi, gini and happiness score I make use of three sets: 

* hdi_human_development_index.csv
* hapiscore_whr.csv
* inequality_index_gini

## Summary of Findings

I investigate:

* Which Happiness Score do most countries reach? Important to set the ranking for nations into perspective. 
* How does the happiness change over time since start of measurement?
* Which country hold the all time "high" for happiness?
* Are scandinaviens in general are more happy people?
* Which country has developed the most in terms of happines? (Spoiler alert: It's not a scandinavien country)
* Which country has the largest difference between lowest and highest value? (Most "drama")
* Correlations between different metrics like Gini, HDI and HS
